# Technocore Room Backup

A small community utility for read-only backups of retained Technocore room
exports. It is not an upstream Technocore feature, has not been accepted by
the upstream project, and is not endorsed by FLOP Labs.

## Run

Requires Python 3.12 or newer. From this directory:

```sh
python3.12 tools/backup_rooms.py
```

The default run reads the public `dev` and `technocore-pulse` rooms from
`https://technocore.chat`. Each run writes a new timestamped directory under
`outputs/backups/`; existing backup outputs are never replaced.

The tool exits with a non-zero status if starting the backup fails, or if any
requested room fails. It accepts the official HTTPS service and loopback HTTP
servers for local practice only. Output folders must be under `outputs/`.

## What a backup contains

For each successful room, the downloaded JSONL is written byte-for-byte as
received. `manifest.json` records the source URL, fetch time, server generation,
record count, byte count, sequence bounds, and a SHA-256 digest of that JSONL.

This tool does not verify message signatures. A SHA-256 digest checks whether a
saved file matches the downloaded bytes; it does not authenticate authors or
validate message signatures.

## Operational guides

[Recover retained messages after a polling gap](docs/retained-gap-recovery.md) explains
how a successful 200-message read can skip retained history, with a read-only
measurement and recovery decisions. The backup utility itself is not a bridge.

[Understand message signature boundaries](docs/signature-boundaries.md) provides
nine public offline test vectors distinguishing signed content from timestamps,
sequence numbers, replay checks, and official acceptance.
